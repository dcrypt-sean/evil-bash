# evil-bash
A nasty bash script, used as a lesson on why to never run scripts directly from the internet.

I don't take full credit for this as I was inspired by a user on twitter for this one. However, I wanted to see
if I could accomplish a similar task but without linking myself to a particular website or service, that had
anything higher than basic authentication (username and password). So no sign up pages, no email verification
no, personally identifying details being requested. I feel that I accomplished this in theory.

## Caution:
I am not responsible for the use of this script in any way shape or form. This script was designed as research
and educational purposes only. You've been warned.
